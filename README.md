30MFF Web Site - Eyes Open

This website debuts and brands 'Eyes Open', a short action open ending film. The title of the film gives an awakening & 'watch-out' sense which associates with the theme of the film and the 3 eyes logo, a symbol for the three girls. The whole website experience relates to a real film viewing experience, in which the user first looks through the poster of the film on the 'Home Page', then reads 'About' the film and production, and later views the film. The user experience is further developed by allowing the user to choose their own ending for the film, and a response is generated when an option is chosen, which reflects the user's thinking. The overall concept had an initial idea of using 'eyes' as the main theme, but the eyes developed to become more than that by being interactive in every way: to navigate through the pages, to symbolize the three girls, and to act as a logo on every page. 


Comix Strip - Spooky Night

This website involves a riddle experience which is enhanced by ghost world speech reacting to human world jokes. The title is “Spooky Night”, chosen to give a sense of the whole website theme before the user begins to use it. The story is situated in a Halloween themed party in the ghost world, where the festivity features the telling of human riddle jokes, just how the human world use ghost stories in Halloween. The riddle experience is not only created for the ghosts to interact with, but at the same time, there is time for the user to think about the answers of the riddle as they are scrolling down, so it is a dual experience. 
Our initial idea was having two people joking around the riddles and the answers would show up as illustrations. When the illustrations were starting to develop, ghosts were drawn instead of humans, and this idea came out unexpectedly and genuinely. The jokes were originally created using Adobe Illustrator and were interactively integrated into the webpage with animating each of their elements uniquely. As the webpage started to evolve, we lacked an overall theme and a color palette; as we started integrating the ghost characters into the webpage, an idea popped up for a Halloween themed webpage, which was very fitting with the ghost characters. At this point, an overall theme had been developed, but not a solid storyline. As the characters and theme was set, the storyline that suited both equally was created: 2 ghosts attending a Halloween party joke about the human world. The incorporation of the ghosts was planned to create an inclusion experience to users, whether they were particularly interested in the riddle jokes and found them funny, or they were bewildered by the jokes and confused, just as how the two ghosts had totally different reactions to the jokes. The colors of the webpage were chosen to suit a Halloween party theme, but the colors of the jokes were significantly different for the purpose of showing the difference between the human world inside the joke and the ghost world outside. The characters “friends” in the jokes were also purposed to give a Halloween sense by how significantly they were each illustrated.
Generally, our initial concept of riddle jokes did get implemented, but in a very different theme than we expected it to be, even if we did not have an initial theme. I think the webpage’s interactivity turned out to be engaging very well with the user as we had originally thought, in which they are involved in the storyline and answering the questions with the ghosts. The Halloween theme was not anticipated in the end, but I think when it was implemented, it was the thing that linked everything in the webpage together, from the ghost characters to the storyline, jokes and color palette of the webpage.
