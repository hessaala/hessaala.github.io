30MFF Web Site - Eyes Open
This website debuts and brands 'Eyes Open', a short action open ending film. The title of the film gives an awakening & 'watch-out' sense which associates with the theme of the film and the 3 eyes logo, a symbol for the three girls. The whole website experience relates to a real film viewing experience, in which the user first looks through the poster of the film on the 'Home Page', then reads 'About' the film and production, and later views the film. The user experience is further developed by allowing the user to choose their own ending for the film, and a response is generated when an option is chosen, which reflects the user's thinking. The overall concept had an initial idea of using 'eyes' as the main theme, but the eyes developed to become more than that by being interactive in every way: to navigate through the pages, to symbolize the three girls, and to act as a logo on every page.
