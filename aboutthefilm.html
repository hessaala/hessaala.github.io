    <h1> About Eyes Open </h1>
    <h2> Film Description </h2>
    <p> This is not about how thievery is bad nor it is for normalizing it. It is not about villains and heroes, or about victims 
        and their stories. This is about unexpected moments and how we humans deal with them.   </p>
    <p>It is all about what we choose to happen and what really happens in the end. But this is a story with a beginning and a middle, with no end.</p>

    <h2> Production by Cineast </h2>
    <p>Cineast is an Abu Dhabi - based production and distribution company with a core team of directors, filmmakers,
